# Image Spider

## Description
Crawling images in a specific HTML page based on the [Scrapy][] framework. Obtained data is mainly used for a face identification project. This spider can be futher improved to crawl images from any modern search engines.

Two modules:
* Spider (actor_spider) based on [Scrapy][]
* Filter (data_postprocess) based on [SeetaFace][]

For dynamic web pages generated by JavaScript, I used the [Scrapy-Splash][] to get the whole pages which contain much more face images.
> Scrapy-Splash uses Splash HTTP API, so you also need a Splash instance. Usually to install & run Splash, something like this is enough:
```Shell
$ docker run -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash
```
